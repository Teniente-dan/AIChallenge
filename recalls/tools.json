Playskool received reports that a 19-month-old boy from Martinsburg, W.V., and a 2-year-old boy from League City, Texas, suffocated when oversized, plastic toy nails sold with the tool bench toys became forcefully lodged in their throats. Though the toy nails are not considered a small-part, and the toys are intended for children age 3 and older, Playskool is voluntarily conducting a recall as a precaution to prevent additional incidents. The Team Talkin' Tool Bench™ is a 20-inch tall plastic toy tool bench with an animated red toy saw, a yellow toy drill and a blue toy vice. The toy talks and makes various sound effects, including tool sounds. The product also includes a toy hammer, screwdriver, two 2¼-inch plastic screws, two 3-inch plastic nails and pieces to build a small toy plane. The red Playskool logo is on the front of the brown surface of the tool bench. The toy was sold at Toys R Us, Wal-Mart, Target, KB Toys stores and various other stores nationwide from October 2005 through September 2006 for about $35. Consumers should immediately take the two toy nails away from children and contact Playskool to get information on returning the nails for a $50 certificate for a Playskool (or its related companies') product. For additional information, call Playskool at (800) 509-9554 anytime, or go to their Web site at www.playskool.co",

Recalls Portable Air Compressors NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 26, 2002 Release # 02-108 Ingersoll-Rand's Recall Hotline: (877) 552-2952 CPSC Consumer Hotline: (800) 638-2772 CPSC Media Contact: Kim Dulic, (301) 504-7058 CPSC, Ingersoll-Rand Co. Announce Recall of Portable Air Compressors Sold Between 1983 and 1991 WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Ingersoll-Rand Company, of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., is voluntarily recalling about 458,000 portable air compressors sold between 1983 and 1991. Internal corrosion to the inner wall of the air receiver tank can cause the air tank to unexpectedly rupture allowing pressurized air to suddenly and forcefully escape, posing risk of injury to consumers. Ingersoll-Rand has received 11 reports of sudden tank failure in these portable air compressors. No injuries have been reported. The recalled portable compressors have single-phase electric motors up to 3hp or gasoline engines up to 8hp with tank sizes up to 30 gallons. The compressors were marketed under various brand names, including Ajax, Charge Air Pro, Energair, Guardian Power, MacTool, Power Force, Rallye, Rand 4000, and Steel Driver. The compressors have serial numbers beginning with the prefix \"C\" or \"DC\". The model numbers begin with the following prefixes - 1B, 1D, 1E, 1I, 2B, 2D, 2E, 3B, 3D, 3E, 4B, 4E, 5E, 5G, 15E, 23HP, 75, 75E, 250E, AB, AIR, AJ, C, CAP, CB, CL, CO, CP, CR, CS, CT, EA, GC, GP, HP, HPC, IR, IRC, LTD, MT, OI, PF, RA, RL, RP, RY, SC, SDS, SE, THP, and WB. Model and serial numbers are located on a plate or sticker attached to the outside housing of the air compressor. On some oil-less models, the model and serial numbers are affixed to an internal floor baffle beneath a removable plastic cabinet. Hardware and construction supply stores nationwide sold the air compressors from 1983 through 1991 for between $150 and $400. Air compressor receiver tanks do not have an infinite life. Tank life is dependent upon several factors, some of which include operating conditions, ambient conditions, proper installations, field modifications, and the level of maintenance. The exact effect of these factors on air receiver life is difficult to predict. Due to the current age of these products, Ingersoll-Rand is voluntarily undertaking this action to take these products out of service. Consumers should stop using the air compressors immediately and contact Ingersoll-Rand for instructions on returning the compressor, freight paid. Consumers will have the option of being sent a check for $100.00 or receiving a $200.00 credit towards the purchase of a new DD2T2 air compressor. For more information, consumers can contact Ingersoll-Rand at (877) 552-2952 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday or visit the firm's web site at www.air.ingersoll-rand.com (note recall no longer available on firm's web site).",

Hardware stores, tool dealers, and home centers sold the tools nationwide from November 1994 through November 1995. The Angle Sander sold for $269; the seven-inch Angle Grinder sold for $288; and the nine-inch Angle Grinder sold for $294.Consumers who own one of the recalled angle grinders or angle sanders should immediately stop using the tool and return it to the nearest Makita factory or authorized service center for repair.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Originally issued February 24, 1984, Revised August 18, 2003 Release # 84-012 Central Quality Industries Provided Blade Guards For Saw Tables Washington, D.C.-- Central Quality Industries, Polo, Illinois, in cooperation with the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, announced a program to provide free blade guards to owners of Central Quality Industries and Pow-R-Tool saw tables.

The firm has received 6 injury complaints, including 4 reports of finger amputation and 2 reports of finger lacerations associated with the use and operation of the saw tables without the blade guards. The saw tables are designed to hold a portable circular saw, sabre saw, and routers so that it can be used as a table saw. Approximately 166,304 saw tables have been distributed by the firm since the late 1950's under the brand name of \"Central Quality Industries\" and \"Pow-R-Tool Table\", which appears on the table top. The product has been sold nationwide and is available with a metal or plastic top, with or without legs, and retailed between $49.95 and $89.95.
